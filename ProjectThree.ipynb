    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the behaviour of thermal neutrons passing through various shielding materials. The aim is to model neutron scattering, absorption, and transmission processes within slabs of water, lead, and graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating random numbers, random points in three dimensions, and implementing exponential distributions, we build up to a full neutron transport simulation. We will visualise random walks, quantify transmission, reflection, and absorption rates, and determine the characteristic attenuation lengths for different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Verify the generation of uniform random numbers using `numpy.random.uniform()`.\n",
    "  1. Generate and visualise random 3D points to assess distribution properties.\n",
    "  1. Create and test an exponential random number generator.\n",
    "  1. Produce isotropic random directions and isotropic steps with exponentially distributed lengths.\n",
    "  1. Simulate neutron random walks through slabs of different materials.\n",
    "  1. Quantify neutron absorption, reflection, and transmission rates as functions of slab thickness.\n",
    "  1. Determine attenuation lengths from transmission data.\n",
    "  1. Implement the Woodcock method to simulate transport through two adjacent materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we aim to support the simulation with appropriate plots and discuss the numerical results, including any uncertainties."

    "## 5 Survival Function Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the attenuation length of neutrons passing through a shielding material, we analyse the *survival function* — the number of neutrons that have travelled at least a given distance without being absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is to bin neutron travel distances into discrete intervals and count the number of surviving neutrons per bin. However, binning introduces systematic errors whenever a continuous distribution is discretised. This is particularly problematic for exponential decay, which is highly left-skewed: many neutrons are absorbed at short distances, and relatively few travel far. As a result, binning can distort the survival curve, leading to bias in attenuation length estimates — especially when using bin midpoints or edges that misrepresent the average behaviour within each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these artefacts, we instead adopt a *ranked method*. We generate continuous travel distances for a large number of neutrons, sort them in ascending order, and assign each a survival rank: the number of neutrons that travelled at least that far. This produces a smooth, high-resolution survival curve without requiring any binning. Taking the natural logarithm of the survival rank transforms the exponential decay law into a linear relationship of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(N(x)) = \\log(N_0) - \\frac{x}{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit this relation using weighted linear regression, with each point weighted by the square root of its rank. While these weights are not derived from an explicit statistical uncertainty model, they give greater influence to regions of the curve with more surviving neutrons, where statistical fluctuations would be relatively smaller in a binned context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each plot also includes a dashed line at $N_0 / e$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of neutrons. According to the exponential decay law, the distance at which the survival function intersects this line corresponds to the attenuation length $\\lambda$ of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ranked, weighted approach allows us to obtain a precise estimate of attenuation length without introducing bias from binning. It is applied below to water, using the material’s absorption cross section and neglecting scattering, which is considered later via full random walk simulations."

    "While the theoretical model assumes that neutron transmission through a material decreases exponentially with thickness, our simulation reveals a subtle deviation from this idealised behaviour. When plotting the number of transmitted particles as a function of material thickness, the curve fit deviates slightly from a perfect exponential, particularly at larger thicknesses. One possibility might be due to the physical structure of the simulation: neutrons start their path lengths at random distances inside the material (consistent with an exponential distribution), but particles that are reflected or absorbed before completing a full exponential step effectively truncate the distribution. As a result, the ensemble of transmission probabilities across many particles is not a pure exponential function of thickness. This effect is small but observable, and fitting only thicknesses around the attenuation length or thinner yields a closer match to the expected exponential decay and a more accurate attenuation length."

    "## 7. Simulating Transmission Through Adjacent Slabs Using the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extension task, we apply the **Woodcock method** (also known as delta-tracking) to simulate neutron transmission through multiple adjacent slabs composed of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrons are fired perpendicularly into the slabs at $x = 0$ and undergo stochastic random walks based on the Woodcock sampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we compare the **total macroscopic cross-sections** of the materials and identify the maximum value, $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$. This value is used for sampling step lengths throughout the entire simulation, ensuring uniform handling of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step:\n",
    "- A random step length is drawn from an exponential distribution based on $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$.\n",
    "- The neutron moves along a randomly generated isotropic direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each step:\n",
    "  - A uniform random number between 0 and 1 is generated.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **less than** the **acceptance probability** (defined as $\\Sigma_{\\text{material}} / \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), the interaction is considered **real**.\n",
    "    - In this case, we proceed to determine whether the neutron is absorbed, transmitted, or reflected.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **greater than** the acceptance probability, the interaction is treated as a **virtual collision**.\n",
    "    - No physical interaction (absorption or scattering) occurs.\n",
    "    - The neutron simply continues with a new random step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the neutron is in the most dense material in the supplied slabs (i.e., $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), every interaction is automatically accepted without rejection sampling due to the probability of the collision being real `p_real` having the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions are handled as follows:\n",
    "- If the neutron moves beyond $x > 2L$, it is considered **transmitted**.\n",
    "- If it moves back through $x < 0$, it is considered **reflected**.\n",
    "- If it undergoes a real collision inside the slab, absorption or scattering is determined based on the material properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows efficient and unbiased simulation of neutron transport through inhomogeneous materials with different cross-sections."
