    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the behaviour of thermal neutrons passing through various shielding materials. The aim is to model neutron scattering, absorption, and transmission processes within slabs of water, lead, and graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating random numbers, random points in three dimensions, and implementing exponential distributions, we build up to a full neutron transport simulation. We will visualise random walks, quantify transmission, reflection, and absorption rates, and determine the characteristic attenuation lengths for different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verify the generation of uniform random numbers using `numpy.random.uniform()`.\n",
    "- Generate and visualise random 3D points to assess distribution properties.\n",
    "- Create and test an exponential random number generator.\n",
    "- Produce isotropic random directions and isotropic steps with exponentially distributed lengths.\n",
    "- Simulate neutron random walks through slabs of different materials.\n",
    "- Quantify neutron absorption, reflection, and transmission rates as functions of slab thickness.\n",
    "- Determine attenuation lengths from transmission data.\n",
    "- Implement the Woodcock method to simulate transport through two adjacent materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we aim to support the simulation with appropriate plots and discuss the numerical results, including any uncertainties."

    "## 5 Survival Function Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the attenuation length of neutrons passing through a shielding material, we analyse the survival function — the number of neutrons that have travelled at least a given distance without being absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One basic approach to constructing the survival function is to bin the neutron travel distances into discrete intervals and count the number of neutrons surviving within each bin. However, binning inherently introduces systematic error whenever a continuous distribution is discretised. Unless bins are infinitesimally small, each bin groups together neutrons that travelled different distances, distorting the true shape of the survival function. This distortion is particularly severe for exponential decay processes, which are \"left-heavy\" — most neutrons are absorbed at short distances, and relatively few survive to large distances. When bin midpoints are used, the majority of events occur to the left of the bin centre, leading to a systematic rightward bias: the binned survival function falsely suggests that neutrons survive slightly longer than they actually do. Alternative schemes such as left-edge binning can overcompensate, introducing a leftward bias. To avoid all such bias, we adopt a ranked method, sorting individual neutron travel distances and computing the number of survivors directly, without binning. This ensures that the survival function accurately reflects the underlying physics of neutron attenuation without distortion from binning artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each survival count is subject to Poisson statistics, the uncertainty in the number of surviving neutrons $ N(x)$ is approximately $\\sqrt{N(x)}$. When fitting the logarithm of the survival function, the corresponding uncertainty in $\\log(N(x))$ is $1/\\sqrt{N(x)}$. Therefore, when performing a weighted linear regression of $\\log(\\text{survivors})$ against distance, we assign each point a weight proportional to $\\sqrt{N(x)}$, ensuring that points with higher neutron counts (and thus lower relative noise) have greater influence on the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each survival function plot, we also display a horizontal dashed line at $N_0/e$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of neutrons. Theoretically, this line represents the expected number of surviving neutrons after travelling one attenuation length through the material, as given by the exponential decay law $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$. The $x$ value of its inersection with the fitted function gives the attenuation\n",
    "length of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "By fitting the survival function using this ranked, weighted approach, we obtain a highly accurate estimate of the material’s attenuation length while minimising systematic bias from data binning. This method is conducted for water:\n",
    "\n",
    "The material’s absorption cross section is used while scattering is neglected at this stage. Scattering is more complex and requires a full random walk simulation, which is carried out later."

    "While the theoretical model assumes that neutron transmission through a material decreases exponentially with thickness, our simulation reveals a subtle deviation from this idealised behaviour. When plotting the number of transmitted particles as a function of material thickness, the curve fit deviates slightly from a perfect exponential, particularly at larger thicknesses. This discrepancy arises due to the physical structure of the simulation: neutrons start their path lengths at random distances inside the material (consistent with an exponential distribution), but particles that are reflected or absorbed before completing a full exponential step effectively truncate the distribution. As a result, the ensemble of transmission probabilities across many particles is not a pure exponential function of thickness. This effect is small but observable, and fitting only the early portion of the data — before transmission drops below $1/e$ — yields a closer match to the expected exponential decay and a more accurate attenuation length."

    "## 7. Stretch Yourself: Simulating Transmission Through Two Adjacent Slabs Using the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extension task, we apply the **Woodcock method** (also known as delta-tracking) to simulate neutron transmission through two adjacent slabs composed of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each slab has a thickness of $L$, giving a total system thickness of $2L$. Neutrons are fired perpendicularly into the slabs at $x = 0$ and undergo stochastic random walks based on the Woodcock sampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we compare the **total macroscopic cross-sections** of the two materials and identify the maximum value, $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$. This value is used for sampling step lengths throughout the entire simulation, ensuring uniform handling of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step:\n",
    "- A random step length is drawn from an exponential distribution based on $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$.\n",
    "- The neutron moves along a randomly generated isotropic direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each step:\n",
    "- If the neutron is currently in the **lower cross-section material**, we apply a **rejection sampling check**:\n",
    "  - A uniform random number between 0 and 1 is generated.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **less than** the **acceptance probability** (defined as $\\Sigma_{\\text{material}} / \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), the interaction is considered **real**.\n",
    "    - In this case, we proceed to determine whether the neutron is absorbed, transmitted, or reflected.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **greater than** the acceptance probability, the interaction is treated as a **virtual collision**.\n",
    "    - No physical interaction (absorption or scattering) occurs.\n",
    "    - The neutron simply continues with a new random step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the neutron is in the **higher cross-section material** (i.e., $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), every interaction is automatically accepted without rejection sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions are handled as follows:\n",
    "- If the neutron moves beyond $x > 2L$, it is considered **transmitted**.\n",
    "- If it moves back through $x < 0$, it is considered **reflected**.\n",
    "- If it undergoes a real collision inside the slab, absorption or scattering is determined based on the material properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows efficient and unbiased simulation of neutron transport through inhomogeneous materials with different cross-sections."
