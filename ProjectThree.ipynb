    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the behaviour of thermal neutrons passing through various shielding materials. The aim is to model neutron scattering, absorption, and transmission processes within slabs of water, lead, and graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating random numbers, random points in three dimensions, and implementing exponential distributions, we build up to a full neutron transport simulation. We will visualise random walks, quantify transmission, reflection, and absorption rates, and determine the characteristic attenuation lengths for different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Verify the generation of uniform random numbers using `numpy.random.uniform()`.\n",
    "  2. Generate and visualise random 3D points to assess distribution properties.\n",
    "  3. Create and test an exponential random number generator.\n",
    "  4. Produce isotropic random directions and isotropic steps with exponentially distributed lengths.\n",
    "  5. Simulate neutron random walks through slabs of different materials.\n",
    "  6. Quantify neutron absorption, reflection, and transmission rates as functions of slab thickness.\n",
    "  7. Determine attenuation lengths from transmission data.\n",
    "  8. Implement and verify the Woodcock method for simulating neutron transport through two adjacent materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we aim to support the simulation with appropriate plots and discuss the numerical results, including any uncertainties."

    "We begin by simulating neutron penetration depths into various materials, assuming **pure absorption** with **no scattering**. In this simplified model, each neutron travels in a straight line and is absorbed at a random depth determined by the material's **macroscopic absorption cross section**, $\\Sigma_a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution for the depth $x$ at which a neutron is absorbed follows an exponential decay:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x) = \\Sigma_a e^{-\\Sigma_a x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the number of neutrons surviving at least a distance $x$ (the **survival function**) decreases exponentially.\n",

    "We repeated this process for 10,000 neutrons per trial and construct a histogram of absorption depths. To reduce statistical noise, we run 10 independent simulations and compute the **mean and standard deviation** of the binned survival function across those trials.\n",

This method, while more computationally expensive than analytic formulas, provides a reproducible and robust estimate of variability without relying on distributional assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method — which is commonly used in similar contexts — would be to apply binomial or Gaussian error propagation formulas based on the number of simulated neutrons. This would significantly reduce computation time but assumes ideal statistical behaviour, which may not always capture the nuances of stochastic simulations involving random walks and boundary conditions.\n",

Water, being hydrogen-rich, has a high number density of effective scatterers, leading to frequent collisions. Lead, despite its high mass density, has a relatively low number density of scattering centres and a smaller cross section for neutrons, resulting in fewer interactions. Graphite, with its light nuclei and sparse structure, allows neutrons to travel the farthest between collisions."

    "\n",
    "We now simulate neutron random walks through a finite slab of material. \n",
    "Each slab is placed between two planes located at $x = 0$ and $x = L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, neutrons are fired **perpendicularly into the slab** from the left boundary at $x = 0$, moving along the positive $x$-axis. \n",
    "Each neutron then undergoes a stochastic random walk within the slab:\n",
    "- The step size is sampled from the same exponential distribution used in Section 6.2, with mean free path $\\lambda$ determined by the material's macroscopic cross-section.\n",
    "- After each step, the neutron's new position is updated by moving along a randomly generated isotropic unit vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, we determine whether the neutron:\n",
    "- **Is absorbed** within the slab (random survival check against absorption probability),\n",
    "- **Scatters** and continues walking within the slab,\n",
    "- **Escapes** by crossing beyond the slab boundaries (either $x < 0$ or $x > L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The random walk terminates if the neutron is absorbed or escapes.\n",
    "We visualise individual neutron trajectories through the slab for different materials, illustrating the stochastic scattering and absorption behaviour in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple `random_walk` function is now replaced with a version that takes a slab of material and performs a full walk until an end condition (escape or absorb) is met."

    "### 6.5 Variation of Neutron Interaction Rates with Slab Thickness\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse how neutron behaviour varies with slab thickness $L$, we perform repeated random walk simulations for a range of thicknesses. For each slab thickness, the absorption, reflection, and transmission rates are computed as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error-Based Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than fixing the number of simulation batches in advance, we continue running batches of simulations **until the standard deviation of each outcome falls below a target threshold** (we have chosen 0.03 as a good tradeoff between accuracy and computation time). This ensures we adaptively allocate more computation only where necessary, such as around the critical transition regions where transmission probabilities drop off sharply.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to maintain statistical accuracy **without wasting computation** on slabs that already give stable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `trials` parameter controls the number of independent simulations per batch (default is 10).\n",
    "- The `batch_size` parameter controls how often convergence is checked. We typically use a small value (e.g. 5), since the **random walk simulation dominates runtime**, and large batches could overshoot the desired accuracy. Smaller batches allow earlier convergence detection.\n",
    "- On slower machines, you can raise the target error (e.g. from 0.03 to 0.05) or reduce the number of steps to improve speed, at the cost of increased uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attenuation Length Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the attenuation length $\\lambda$, we focus on the transmission rate as a function of slab thickness. According to theory, the transmission should decay exponentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We transform this into a linear function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln T(x) = -\\frac{x}{\\lambda} + \\ln T_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to perform a **weighted linear regression** (not a nonlinear curve fit) on the logarithm of the transmission values, using the standard deviation of each point as the fitting weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the fitted slope $m$, we compute the attenuation length:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{m}, \\quad \\sigma_\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_m}{m^2}$$\n",

    "While the theoretical model assumes that neutron transmission through a material decreases exponentially with thickness, our simulation reveals a subtle but consistent deviation from this idealised behaviour. When plotting the number of transmitted particles as a function of material thickness, the observed data does not follow a perfect exponential trend — particularly at larger thicknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deviation is small but measurable, and suggests that the ideal exponential model does not fully capture the behaviour of our stochastic simulation. The precise cause of this discrepancy is unclear, but it is likely related to the cumulative effects of random walk geometry, absorption probabilities, and simulation boundary conditions.\n",

    "## 7. Simulating Transmission Through Adjacent Slabs Using the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this extension task, we apply the **Woodcock method** (also known as delta-tracking) to simulate neutron transmission through multiple adjacent slabs composed of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrons are fired perpendicularly into the slabs at $x = 0$ and undergo stochastic random walks based on the Woodcock sampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the Woodcock Method\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we compare the **total macroscopic cross-sections** of the materials and identify the maximum value, $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$. This value is used for sampling step lengths throughout the entire simulation, ensuring uniform handling of different materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step:\n",
    "- A random step length is drawn from an exponential distribution based on $\\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$.\n",
    "- The neutron moves along a randomly generated isotropic direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each step:\n",
    "  - A uniform random number between 0 and 1 is generated.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **less than** the **acceptance probability** (defined as $\\Sigma_{\\text{material}} / \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), the interaction is considered **real**.\n",
    "    - In this case, we proceed to determine whether the neutron is absorbed, transmitted, or reflected.\n",
    "  - If the random number is **greater than** the acceptance probability, the interaction is treated as a **virtual collision**.\n",
    "    - No physical interaction (absorption or scattering) occurs.\n",
    "    - The neutron simply continues with a new random step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the neutron is in the most dense material in the supplied slabs (i.e., $\\Sigma = \\Sigma_{\\text{max}}$), every interaction is automatically accepted without rejection sampling due to the probability of the collision being real `p_real` having the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary conditions are handled as follows:\n",
    "- If the neutron moves beyond $x > 2L$, it is considered **transmitted**.\n",
    "- If it moves back through $x < 0$, it is considered **reflected**.\n",
    "- If it undergoes a real collision inside the slab, absorption or scattering is determined based on the material properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows efficient and unbiased simulation of neutron transport through inhomogeneous materials with different cross-sections."
